# Final-Project-ADC

In this repository you can find several data sets regarding The Grammy Awards.

FOUR BIG CATEGORIES
 - ROTY.xlsx (Record Of The Year)
 - AOTY.xlsx (Album Of The Year)
 - SOTY.xlsx (Song Of the Year)
 - BNA.xlsx (Best New Artist)

GENRE CATEGORIES
 - BPS.xlsx (Best Pop Solo Performance)
 - BPDGP.xlsx (Best Pop Duo/Group Performance)

The data is dated from the 2000 onward except for the two genre categories that were introduced in 2012.

There is also a data set for the nationalities (nationalities.xlsx) of each nominee. However, the entries of this data set are not the individual artists. They are written exactly like they appear in the column "artist" (ROTY, AOTY, SOTY, BOS and BPDGP) or "nominee" (BNA) meaning that some of them appear with featurings.

These data sets were specially build to do this project, that is why the "nationalities" data set was created in this particular way.

On the other hand, there is a GRAMMY.R script where all the code used to charge and analyse the data provided along with a Kaggle data set (Billboard 'The Hot 100' Songs by Dhruvil Dave. Can be find following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs)
